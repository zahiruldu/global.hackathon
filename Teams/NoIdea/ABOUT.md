We are part of a young start-up, and we joined this hackathon to challenge ourselves and try to get new ideas and renew our determination to keep going forward.

About skills and project
========================
The goal of our project is to show the correlation between good analogies and the mastering of programming skills via simple games. This corresponds to the second theme.
To be fair, we can work with many languages and frameworks. But, for this particular project, we may use only these:
	- C
	- VB.NET
	- HTML and JS
