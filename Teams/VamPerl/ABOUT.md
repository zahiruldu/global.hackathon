> **Who we are and what do we want?**

> - We're a few humble developers from Cluj-Napoca, Romania, situated in Transylvania, the fearsome land of vampires!
> - Being perl developers, we're considered to be members of the **Perl Counts of Transylvania** - [ClujPM]
> - We're excited about the first worldwide online hackathon and would like to be a part of it, take the challenge of competing with other talented developers from all around the world.

> **What technologies do we like?**
######We're interested in a vast array of different technologies and in the way we combine them for a higher goal. Some of our favorite technologies being:
> - Perl frameworks and modules (Dancer, Catalyst, Mojolicious, DBIx::Class etc.)
> - Javascript frameworks (Backbone)
> - HTML5  & CSS3
> - Various APIs
> - Anything old school, new and experimental!

####Good luck to everyone!
