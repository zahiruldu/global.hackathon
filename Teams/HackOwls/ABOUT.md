#### Name: Kleber Virgilio Correia.
- Reason to participate: Firstly, I've never participated in any other hackathon, so, here's my change to give it a try.
Also, which I consider the most import point, the fact that hackathon is global, pleased me!
- Skills: I've been working with WebApps, Market-Places, E-commerces, One-Page-Application, Webservices and API's in the last years, using mainly Ruby and Javascript as the main languages. So, with a these background, I consider myself a full-stack developer, which, I think, will be handy to the team!

I'd love to use Social APIs, as well as real-time, pub-sub and so on...
