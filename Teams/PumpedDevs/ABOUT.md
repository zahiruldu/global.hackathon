================
Hey! You've actually visited our page(?). We are pumpedDevs! We're thrilled to be part of the first Global Hackathon, well actually, this is the first hackathon for some of us. :)


About the team
===========================
Hi, we are **pumpedDevs**(pumped developers)! We're composed of 4 developers who love to develop apps for mobile and for web.

The team was created months ago (*May 2014*) before **Koding's Global Hackathon**. The original members were me(Ron), Bryan, and a friend of mine(*Not in the competition*). We established this team because of some reasons and our main goal is to start our own. We wanted to build our own **start up company**. Our problem is, **we don't have any idea how**; also our **time** and **budget** won't allow us. (*We have full-time and part time jobs. Long story on why we can't quit in any.*)

The time when we discovered the **hackathon**, we were so *excited*. But when we saw that there were only 1000(*2000 now*) slots for the hackathon, the excitement went down since we thought that it was somehow *"impossible"* for us(me) to be chosen. But I still tried! I told them, *"If we will be chosen, I will treat you guys!"*. So eventually, I treated them at a coffee shop(Starbucks)!

After a while, I asked the other two members to join us in this hackathon, **Kenneth**, my classmate when I was in college, and **Joell** who used to be our professor. They both develop for the **web** and they're **really great** at it so I thought they'd be perfect for the team and so I invited them. I also had an experience developing with them so I think it's an edge for us.

The team's **goal** for this competition is to *have fun* in the hackathon, *show what we can do* and *what we can contribute*. We think that this event is a **big help** for us to reach our goal which is to create our own **start up company** which can be beneficial for a lot of people. *Winning* in this competition might be **hard** and **intimidating**, but what isn't? We'll give it a shot and do our **best**!

About our skills and plans?

All of us use the following technologies:

1. PHP
2. Javascript
3. HTML5

All of the themes given are really interesting. We're still thinking which will fit our skills.

I know this page is a bit long so here's a sweet potato. :sweet_potato: Sorry for the long post
