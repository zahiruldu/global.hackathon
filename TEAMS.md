A single man team with a passion for low level hackery

About 3DPG
----------

| Peter Steidel       |
|---------------------|
| Picture Unavailable |

Description currently being written

Skills
------
Programming languages (that may be used):
	- Assembly
	- C
	- Lisp
	- HTML/CSS and JS

Project
-------

The goal of my project is to show how simplicity and composability can
be used to create extensible, scalable, flexible, small, and fast
software. This corresponds to theme 2 for the hackathon, and there,
maybe, will be a game ^^.


---------------------------------------

# 41 North Studios LLC

My name is Jim Armstrong, and I am the president of 41 North Studios LLC, a small web-design and programming agency
located in Norwalk, CT, USA.

This is my first hackathon and I have entered as a solo participant. I want to challenge myself and see if I can 
take a concept from idea to execution in 48 hours by myself. Above all, I'm hoping to have some fun, learn some 
new things, and be amazed at what everyone creates!

## My favorite languages

I mostly code in C#, Java, and Ruby. For this project I will likely default to Ruby since I am confortable with it 
and think my development time will be faster. However, depending on what I decide to build I may just try a language 
I'm not as familiar with to make this a good learning experience.


---------------------------------------



55by19Koders

We are programmers working on our day jobs writing software,web apps, scripts,android apps et al. But there is something about
writing code that you really want to write, stuff that you try and build ( stuff that you dream off) in your free time.
This is what we would like to do, doing it in a time constraint environment, so as to have a minimum viable solution working
in quick time.

What are we going to do?

Theme: Problems facing our planet, explained using interactive data visualization. We love data and how to visualise it, we live in a world
where increasingly we are collecting data for various purposes, right from selling adverts to doing health research. This hack weekend
gives us a great opportunity to play with various APIs and build something useful off them.

Why are we participating?

This is our first hackathon per see. We just want to have a blast trying to do stuff , that we really would like to do. Period!


---------------------------------------

*720devs*

We're the founders of 720developments.com, as you can see in our webpage, we're a couple that is working with web developments together since we're just 21 years old (and dating since we're just 17). 7 years later since we starting on our own, we are still here, doing the same but in more interesting projects, trying to learn as much as we can in our free time, and trying to travel as much as we can with our budget.
Also we love to eat, drink good beer (we may start making our own next year) and walk long distances talking about, well, anything, with our 3 little dogs.

*What are we going to do?*

Theme: Problems facing our planet, explained using interactive data visualization.
We will focus in using an API to gather data about different problematics we're (as humanity) facing in this moment. 
We're going to try to do so in a simpler manner, so everyone can read clearly what's going on.

We choose that because we think that we are in the era of knowledge, because we have tons of data collected,
and every year more and more people is accessing to the internet.
Having companies focusing on getting objective data to show to the people instead of having just a few organizations 
deciding what information to show us, is a great step to get to a global agreement of how to manage our resources and
efforts to build a better and more equal world.

Also we think about learning tools, because we believe the future of education is in the web, but we prefer the
other theme better as we think they're already great tools out there that are doing very good right now.

*Why are we participating?*

Is the first time in a hackaton together, and the reasons are several, 
I'll enumerate the most important ones:
1. We have a bit more of time this year, and we think is a fun way to spend a weekend.
2. We think we're in a good moment as developers to do something great in just 2 days. 
3. We get surprised by the big amount of APIs out there with awesome information, and is a good excuse to play with them.
4. We will love to show our work to the great jury, having some chance to get to talk with some of them, is really the great prize of this competition.

we don't have time to join, we have a physics midterm on saturday and a never-ending history project that haunts us
and I suspect it will break the bonds of our friendships. so that's why we decided to join.

we all have it in our hearts to program something. we've all been this way when we met at the ORPHANAGE in Ankara,
we all studied very hard, putting aside coding, to go to university and just as when we were thinking we'll be having
a good time, we are doomed to do homework and all. 


we are incredibly skillful young fellows.

# Antonio

Hi! I'm an individual developer, excited to participate in the Hackathon.

## About Me

My name is Anton, you can also call me Antonio. I didn't think much about team name, it got to be just my name:).
I'm a PHP developer, also good in JavaScript. For backend I'm using PHP framework called Yii 2. This powerful thing 
leads PHP on completely different level.
And of course I like frontend too, so I got to be familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, especially jQuery, an 
awesome JavaScript library.

Looking forward when the koding battle begins... And let the strongest to win!

## Languages and tools I like

-- [Yii Framework](http://www.yiiframework.com/) v2.0 (based on PHP)  
-- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) (based on JavaScript)  
-- HTML 5, CSS 3  
-- DBMS: MySQL or [MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.org/)  
-- [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/) (honestly didn't use, but want to try (!) )  

-- and Java (I know it is completely different from PHP, but since I tried it, I really liked it. Although I'm not going 
to use it for the Hackathon, because don't have enough XP for that.)

## About my project

Most of all I want my project to be really useful for people. It is a primary purpose, because if it becomes useful, it is 
always possible to make it awesome.

Axon
====

I am Daniel Masterson, a second year university student at the University of Hull (UK) currently studying MEng Computer Science With Games Development. I have been interested in programming since the age of 9 where I dove straight in (and straight back out again) to C++. My life has lead me through many languages - PHP, JavaScript, UnrealScript and my all time favourite C#. I'm here to show people what I can do with a free weekend and a lot of JavaScript.

Here's my face from that one time what I done did wear a suit to:
<img width="100" height="100" src='https://gravatar.com/avatar/95278064437320be49a4f68d742b9075?size=128' alt='Me'/>

## Why 'Axon'

Because it sounds cool and technical, and my other cool and technical names have been used recently for other things so I kind of had to fall back to this. Also, an axon is a core component of a neuron, so natually it means this project is intelligent, right?

## My Languages

Where to begin...
- C and C++
- C# (And a bit of Java)
- PHP
- JavaScript with JQuery
- UnrealScript (with the Unreal Development Kit)
- Visual Basic if the need arises
- A bunch of other things I've dabbled in like x86 Assembly, Python, Ruby and more esoteric languages. I even made a Befunge interpreter in HTML and JavaScript because...uh.

## What I will be doing in the project

Due to my almost annoyingly deep knowledge into the intricacies and quirks of JavaScript and JQuery, a large quantity of code will be written in that with either a raw HTML or Canvas front end (I once made a 3D Doom-like engine using CSS 3D transforms on div elements, so I'm not limited to going way out of bounds here!). I personally have not use many frameworks or libraries, but I'll definitely investigate whats on offer and see if it will help in my project.

About your team
===========================

We have a junior coder and one not junior any more, and one with some experience.The whole team works with JavaScript, and we think we can do amazing things with JavaScript. We never worked all together on the same project, so this is going to be a challenge, but we're looking forward to it. 

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
The team lead is a Node.js developer and Node.js really does great in doing network requests and putting all the stuff together. The rest of the team also has Node.js experience, so we're going to pull in a lot of JavaScript.

The idea is to create a mesh of the existing public APIs and gather publicly available data and create a useful dashboard for displaying and manipulating this data. We want to pull in as much data as we can and then show it in an interesting way

# Codeepy

We are a bunch of geeks who love to learn and master software development technologies. We are more than we are. We are ONE.

## About Us

- Abdush loves Java since he started to write his first code in this programming language. He formerly worked on several projects to provide software solutions with optimum algorithms in Sudan. He is regarded as expert by his friends due to his prominent experience in software and managerial skills. In his free time, you can find him talking with his friends or doing sport activities.
- Dommy has more than 5 years experience of professional software development in 2 different countries. He has been fallen in love with .NET since he learned how to write "Hello World!" program. Python - his second love - took his heart recently. In his spare time, Dommy enjoys watching football matches with his friends and arguing about some stupid things.
- Elchin was previously at ASPU, where he worked as an engineer-programmer. He was part of the Startup team working on the project called "Virtual Education System", which has been acquired by three large universities in Azerbaijan. In his spare time, Elchin likes playing chess and brainstorming with his friends.
- Halim loved Java before, but after years of playing with many different programming languages, he just doesn't have any tendency towards any specific programming language anymore. His greatest dream is to meet with a programming language or framework that can handle cross language problem. But what defines him most, Halim loves Manchester United. XD
- After his first programming class during his undergraduate studies, Somdip fell in love with coding and he never turned back since then. His one and only ambition is to help people through programming solutions. When he is not saving the world with coding, he can be found wandering the world to seek trouble and problems, whichever finds him first.

## Languages We Love

- Python
- Java
- C#.NET
- Javascript
- Ruby

I began doing freelance web development in high school, and had become disenchanted with it by the time I reached
University.  However, after working some co-op positions with some passionate web developers, I gained a appreciation
and insight for what the web is capable of.

Now, I'm all about pushing the limits of what the web can do.  I like to think I have some creative and innovative
ideas to bring to the table, and I'm excited to be taking part in the first ever Global Hackathon.  One day, when events
like this are commonplace, I'll be able to look back and say that I was there for the beginning!


Skills and Direction
=======

My passion has always been in interactive media, anything that takes entertainment beyond something to be simply
consumed, allowing people to influence and engage with it.  I love experimenting with new web technologies to
break expectations regarding the limitations of the web.  My hope is to combine my passion with these
technologies in a result that is both practical and delightful for users.

We are self-taught developers that love to learn new things, especially things that matter in a social context. Our main goal has been to contribute to change the way we treat education in our culture. We share some feelings about formal education and how it should encourage students to care about the society when learning a profession instead to just getting certification. Innovation is something that needs to cover the way we relate to others.

Ivan

Front-end and back-end developer, started his journey into the software development at High School trying a little tricks with html and css by himself. Finished the underdegree in Control and Automation Engineering at IFG Brazil on august 2014. His projects in the college included developing a simple protocol in Python to comunicate traffic control devices and a web interface for users to see data. Recently started to delve into Rails, CSS and Javascript development.

Henrique
========
A passionate software engineer. Started his journey in development late (compared to others) when started his Computer Engineering course at UFG. Later he discovered he really loved that, so he decided to move to a Software Engineering at UFG to focus efforts on software development. Now still coursing, he is focusing his efforts on learning Agile Methodologies, TDD, BDD, Rails, Ruby, metaprogramming and everything related. Wants to make software that matters.

</p>

Hello, we are a team mostly from Japan (Tokyo), except for one of us, Fan, that I would like to call "Fan Fan". Our team name is called Gundam because we like ガンダム！Gundam/ガンダム is a Japanese giant robot mecha anime series and is very popular.

Although there is an explosion in the popularity of computer science in the United States and such, computer science and engineering is still looked down upon in Japan. Engineers are looked down upon in Japan. We want to change this mindset. If we win, we want to use this opportunity and make it so that all Japanese people will realize the power and potential of coding, computer science, and hackathons!

Fanさん以外、私たちは日本にいても、Fanさんも日本が好きです！アメリカなどでは情報工学はもっと大人気になるのに、日本ではまだ工学部は人気ではありません。私たちはその考えを変えたい。もし勝てば、この機会で全部の日本人に情報工学とハッカソンの力と可能性を気づかせます。

Hey Mate! Let me present you the super duper extra megantastic geekomatic **Hack Lenotta Team!** (Badum Cha!)

About your team

| <img width="100" height="100" src='https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/378800000628549804/0fa3b62a9437d0d6271ffa893c59453c_400x400.png' alt='Edoardoo'/> | <img width="100" height="100" src='https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/378800000849480405/be5e58e35437e4ee5154010d0031e696_400x400.jpeg' alt='Baldarn'/>|

We are a two friends, **Edoardo Odorico (edoardoo)** and **Lorenzo Farnararo (baldarn)** from Florence, Italy. We studied both engineer. While we were studying we joined our University Open Source Software Lab, LILiK, where we developed our coding and unix skills, and some free software philosophy. 
Together with other **LILiK** members we began to meet together at Edoardoo's house, in hacking sessions during the weekends. This is where we thought at first one of our success projects: turning lights on and off with an arduino, a raspberry, a pinch of javascript and a lot of hacking nights (usually with some wine, don't forget we're italian). Since we wanted to share our hard and funny work with the rest of the world, we've built a blog/tutorial about our hacking projects, hack.lenotta.com. We mainly hack on arduino, raspberry, antennas, HTML5, Javascript and CSS3. 


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
We're skilled on both frontend and backend development. We'll probably use baaskets of javacript (perhaps for the server side too, why not?) and we would like to bleach the mess of EULA and TOS around, compress it, colour it and... you'll see (me heheheh)...



---------------------------------------

HackOwls
========
__Why do we want to join the competition?__

- To have fun, gain experience, meet new people and form a great team.

Our Team
========

#### Name: Gabriel Dumitrescu
- Reason to participate: Prove that a distributed team can be as productive as a team working in the same room
- Skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS


#### Name: Kleber Virgilio Correia.
- Reason to participate: Firstly, I've never participated in any other hackathon, so, here's my change to give it a try.
Also, which I consider the most import point, the fact that hackathon is global, pleased me!
- Skills: I've been working with WebApps, Market-Places, E-commerces, One-Page-Application, Webservices and API's in the last years, using mainly Ruby and Javascript as the main languages. So, with a these background, I consider myself a full-stack developer, which, I think, will be handy to the team!

I'd love to use Social APIs, as well as real-time, pub-sub and so on...


#### Name: Rajesh Veeranki
- Reason to participate: Learn from others, contribute, fun
- Skills: C++, Javascript, Node.JS, shell scripting. Can contribute as situation demands both front-end and back-end


#### Name: Venkateswaran Selvan
- Reason to participate: For fun, experience and a good team
- Skills: Web technologies (html, css, JS, NodeJS, php) and programming skills (c, c++, core-java, android), I can contribute as both front-end as well as backend developer.


About your skills and what you are going to do?
===============================================

We are interested to work on #5 or #1 theme.

---------------------------------------

## Introducing The Hackateers

We are a group of three hackers hailing from [Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar](http://qatar.cmu.edu).
Two of us are graduates and one is currently a student.
Our members have previously participated in hackathons and even helped organize, mentor, or judge a hackathon or two.
We decided to join this hackathon to combine the different skills and experiences we gathered throughout the different paths we have embarked on to hack on something of great.


## About the team

  - **Ossama Obeid:** I am a research associate working in the field of Natural Language Processing. I have previously co-founded a company working on iOS apps for local clients. My interests include hacking software and hardware, painting, and reading up on Physics, Psychology, and History. Aiming to be a Renaissance man :)

  - **Afnan Fahim:** Hacker for all things front-end and aspiring new media artist. Side hobbies include learning languages. I envision a day when I will be able to travel to any country and communicate kinda sorta effectively.

  - **Mahmoud Alismail:** I am a CS junior at CMU. I enjoy working on computer vision applications and backend development. I like to use Django, Node, and OpenCV on my backends. In my free time, I tend to hack RGB+D cameras as well as highly scalable web applications.


## What are we doing?
Our idea is not solid yet but we will be writing a web app using Python for our back-end and HTML, JS, and CSS for our front-end.
We will be possibly utilizing NLP technologies and APIs such as NLTK, wit.ai, or IBM Watson.

"We" are Huggie -- just a solo team consisting of Matt Huggins of Boulder, CO.
I've been coding since I was 12, professionally for about 11 years now.

I've only been a part of one 3-hour hackathon in the past, and I'd like to start
participating in more.  I have a long history of work, but I'd like to have a
personal portfolio of work outside of the jobs I've held.  I also enjoy coding
in my spare time, so participating in hackathons just makes sense! :)


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======

I grew up coding games in my spare time and went to college for the same.
However, I switched gears in college after taking a web development course, and
that's what I've been doing ever since (with some mobile projects in the mix
too).

For this project, I'll probably try to mix the two, creating a web-based game.
I'm not 100% sure if this is what I'm going to actually do, but it's a pretty
good bet!

# Team In-Toke-A-Bola

Though I'm a team of one, I'm passionate about software development, engineering and just building fun and interesting tools and products.

# About the team
| Eric |
|--
| <img width="100" height="100" src='eric.jpg' alt='Photo of Eric'/> |

# Motivation
I've joined this hackathon because I'm trying to bootstrap 2 companies in my time outside of my normal (full-time) day to day job.  Winning this competition could help me fund operational costs of these companies and build my own software company.  I'm passionate about my projects and I'd like to retire at 40.  Then I can enjoy the outdoors more often here in Colorado and focus on supporting various public-serving organizations by building tools and software for them.  Some of those organizations are: [CAIC](http://avalanche.state.co.us/about-us/),   [The Access Fund](http://www.accessfund.org/), [Friends of Berthoud Pass](http://berthoudpass.org/#sthash.FK69QPZG.dpbs), [Friends of Indian Creek](https://friendsofindiancreek.wordpress.com/mission/), ...

# Skills / Concept
I'm skilled in development using a number of different technologies: Java, Ruby on Rails, Angular JS, etc.,  to name a few.

I've seen a number of different HTML5 / Angular Games out there, and that might be what I go for.  I do live in Colorado, so building an app for the Medical Marijuana Industry is not off the table.

We are calling our team (project) Infamy.  The name is because the final day of the competition is "a date which will live in infamy".  One of us loves history, and geography.  One of us is a movie buff.  One of us really enjoys learning design patterns, really.

Tell us who you are, why you did you decide to join?

Jason Hughes (VonMises) is a father of three.  He and his wife homeschool their children.  He worked his way through college working in technical support for a software company that services the hotel industry.  After graduation he transitioned into development, bringing his coworkers (autt and jbeard88) with him.  VonMises is interested in working collaboratively on a project inside a defined window of time.  Even though they work together, they rarely get to be involved with the entire design and devlopment process in a collaborative way.

Our second team mate is Brandon McCartney (autt).  More info to come.

Rounding out the trio is Jeffery Beard (jbeard88).  More info to come.

About your skills and what you are going to do?

are students enrolled in colleges in the United States. We decided to join this competition 
because of our passion for programming and finding solutions for complex problems. We have prior
experience with developing applications making use of real time data to solve everyday problems.
Our biggest motivation behind us taking part in this competition is to get a really good 
feel of some of the API's mentioned in the document. We do not have much experience working with
these API's and would relish the opportunity to build something cool by utilizing them

we decided we'd be the dream team for going into this hackathon together.

About us
===========================
Our team has a yin/yang philosophy. Bobby, the yin, does all the design, CSS,
and UX work. Ali, the yang, does the backend programming to bring everything together.
This works great, as we have skills that compliment each others' weaknesses.

Our name, 'J-Unit', comes from our mutual love of hip hop and unit testing,
mixed with the fact that we use Java as our main programming language, for both client and server side.

Our biggest motivation for participating in this hackathon, is so we can have a shot at an interview
with some of the awesome VCs who are on the judges' panel. Our dream is to do a startup,
and we have an awesome idea that we'd love to pitch.

I am just a developer trying to make a difference. I quit college in the last year to study what I want to study.
The picture you see is me when I was 19 after serving the army here in Brazil. Why did I serve? Just for the sake of it.
I wanted to loose some weight and get paid to do so, at least, that was how I was looking at it. 
Turned out to be one of the greatest experiences of my life and I am fucking proud of it.

I was born in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, my parents managed to move out from Rio to Curitiba, where I currently live in.
Here I managed to get a great education, entered one of the best public schools and got a 100% schollarship from the government and started studying Computer Science at the Catholic University.

I am proud of my achievements but, as I you can see, I am facing this single handed. Why? Because I can't find people that are commited as I am.

I have great friends, don't get me wrong, but none of them is into programming. So, it's just me again facing challenges. 
Hahaha

About the team
===========================
Our team composed from two tech guys (http://twitter.com/v_ignatyev and http://twitter.com/rmartynov), passionate to build and hack. We are from web-app development background.

<img width="100" height="100" src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vladignatyev/global.hackathon/master/Teams/OrangeVerse/lolselfie.jpg' alt='Vladimir's Selfie'/>

I'm Vladimir, a [freelancer at oDesk](https://www.odesk.com/users/~01c0d7f151e8f88b99), software developer, entrepreneur and dog breeder (seriously!). Personally I would like to thank Koding and team to give developers from over the world an opportunity for collaboration and communication. 
I'm happy to see NGINX as partners of this event. 

<img width="100" height="100" src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vladignatyev/global.hackathon/master/Teams/OrangeVerse/martynovselfie.jpeg' alt='Rodion's Selfie'/>

Our team is completely virtual and remote. I met Rodion on Twitter few days ago and have never seen him before. He is great and I love to read his code, that's why we hack together at *OrangeVerse*.

'OrangeVerse' is the random name created using [Koding Global Hackathon Team Name Generator](https://vast-cove-6783.herokuapp.com/), which I created a few days before to give the name for our team. :-)

The team's **goal** for this competition is to *build great thing* during the hackathon and *show what the random can do*. Taleb's Black Swan. In Random We Trust.

Sincerely yours,
Vladimir and Rodion. :p

# Team PhelanGood
One man, on a mission, to save the world through the Koding Global Hackathon. Just kidding.

# About Me
<img width="100" height="100" src='http://i.imgur.com/niC2HLh.png' alt='Hubert'/>

Hi, my name is Hubert Chen. I am a student studying Software Engineering at Monmouth University, which is located in New Jersey, 
USA.

I would like to join this hackathon because it will be a great opportunity to challenge myself to build something that can
create a positive impact. After 4 years of school, I believe I have accumulated enough knowledge to build a full stack system.

As your typical broke college student, winning any sort of prize money would be a extremely helpful. However, given the sheer 
amount of teams (2,000 maximum) and probably being on the low end of experience in the Top Hacker category, the odds of myself
winning are unlikely. This does not deter me. Instead, I hope to try the best that I can and when the competition has subsided, 
analyze other people's work in the hopes that I may find new ways of approaching problems and designing solutions. 

Regardless of whether I get accepted, I would like to applaud the Koding team for hosting this event.

Thank you.

# About the Project
As it isn't the time to learn new technologies, I will be sticking with easy to use and familar technologies. My stack will include: 
Koding for hosting, Apache, MySQL, PHP, Bootstrap, CSS, JQuery, JS, and HTML.

Theme: Problems facing our planet, explained using interactive data visualization.

*APIs: Data.gov, Census.gov, WorldBank.org, Ip2Country through MashApe.

*This is bound to change as I am still playing around with a few ideas.

PumpedDevs
================
Hey! You've actually visited our page(?). We are pumpedDevs! We're thrilled to be part of the first Global Hackathon, well actually, this is the first hackathon for some of us. :)


About the team
===========================
Hi, we are **pumpedDevs**(pumped developers)! We're composed of 4 developers who love to develop apps for mobile and for web.

The team was created months ago (*May 2014*) before **Koding's Global Hackathon**. The original members were me(Ron), Bryan, and a friend of mine(*Not in the competition*). We established this team because of some reasons and our main goal is to start our own. We wanted to build our own **start up company**. Our problem is, **we don't have any idea how**; also our **time** and **budget** won't allow us. (*We have full-time and part time jobs. Long story on why we can't quit in any.*)

The time when we discovered the **hackathon**, we were so *excited*. But when we saw that there were only 1000(*2000 now*) slots for the hackathon, the excitement went down since we thought that it was somehow *"impossible"* for us(me) to be chosen. But I still tried! I told them, *"If we will be chosen, I will treat you guys!"*. So eventually, I treated them at a coffee shop(Starbucks)!

After a while, I asked the other two members to join us in this hackathon, **Kenneth**, my classmate when I was in college, and **Joell** who used to be our professor. They both develop for the **web** and they're **really great** at it so I thought they'd be perfect for the team and so I invited them. I also had an experience developing with them so I think it's an edge for us.

The team's **goal** for this competition is to *have fun* in the hackathon, *show what we can do* and *what we can contribute*. We think that this event is a **big help** for us to reach our goal which is to create our own **start up company** which can be beneficial for a lot of people. *Winning* in this competition might be **hard** and **intimidating**, but what isn't? We'll give it a shot and do our **best**!

About our skills and plans?
=======
All of us use the following technologies:

1. PHP
2. Javascript
3. HTML5

All of the themes given are really interesting. We're still thinking which will fit our skills.

I know this page is a bit long so here's a sweet potato. :sweet_potato: Sorry for the long post

I like the idea of the challenge of a  hackothon as a psychological space well suited to motivating creativity and productivity.  I'm hoping that helps me come up with something interesting and worthwhile outside the scope of my normal work.


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
I'm interested in both the theme of realtime communication and translation and the theme of problems facing our planet and data visualization.

I'm not entirely sure what I'd like to tackle specifically.  Perhaps I'll gather some other devs/designers and come up with a more concrete idea soon.

I am a recent graduate of [Middle East Technical University](http://www.metu.edu.tr/), working at a independent game development company called [Taleworlds Entertainment]. (https://www.taleworlds.com/) Even though I am really interested in the idea, I was not able to participate in more than a couple of hackathons, usually due to the location of most of them being too remote to participate. This one being online is yet another reason that got me excited.

Assignments at school or work may be exciting or educational, but the spontaneity of creativity encouraged in hackathons help get the experience of developing to a whole new level.

I don't think my goal is to win. Rather, it is to produce something that I, and hopefully others as well, would like to make use of.


About our skills and what we are going to do?
=======

The TOS and EULA are one tough nut to crack, but it sure would be fun to tackle it as a weekend project. Any attempt to simplify understanding their coverage would surely require working on the front-end, which would make the implementation part an experimental endeavor to me, as I am more used to working in the back-end. I am still going through the wondrous APIs encouraged, though, and I may end up implementing something based on one (or a few) or them.

We are a team of developers from Russia. We are working on their own start-ups, and some of the projects planned as opensource. We have a lot of interesting ideas, but the need to earn money does not allow us to devote much time to their start-ups. On the competition we have learned from the site habrahabr.ru and very interested as an opportunity to talk with other teams, as well as the chance to get funds for the development of our projects. If we win, the prize money will be spent on the development of useful new services and applications.

About our project.
===========================

We not a choose now which of our ideas to put into Hackathon, but as far as technology, the project will be based on Javascript. On the server we use Node.js, client-server communication via web sockets. Other details we will post before Hackaton.

No regrets, ever.

#About

<img width="100" height="100" src='image.png' alt='Alt text'/>

We're a bunch of high schoolers from Massachusetts, wanting to make a better world in computers.

#Team

###William Tan
 > William, senior in high school, has been coding and using GNU and Linux for 6 years. Some people call him insane for using GNU and Linux exclusively, taping his webcams, password protecting his hacked up calculator, and using Vim instead of an IDE. He is Head of Software Development for his First Tech Challenge Robotics team and also Head of Technology for his school's Physics Club. This year, he carried his team to 113th place out of the over 3000 teams competing in PicoCTF, a computer security challenge. He knows Python, Java, Lua, Javascript, C, Axe, and dabbles in dozens of other languages. He specializes in computer security, GNU and Linux, and networking. Although many people don’t know this and find it hard to believe, William swam for 6 years and dove for his high school swim team.

###Max Krieger

> Max has been doing web development for the past three years, both for fun and for some clients. His projects include [Tabmaster](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabmaster/pojgemmobcnjmnpodjmgeofdgojpkepn), a Chrome extension to help better manage your tabs, and [seae](http://a9.io/Steam-Emoticon-Art-Editor/), a utility for people to create their own pixel art out of the emoticons they own on steam. He programs in full stack js, and has experience in other fields such as game design, UI/UX, graphic design, and photography. He is interested in AI, Control Systems, and eSports.  This is his first hackathon, and he is ready.

###Dianne Lee

> Dianne is a dreamer, a wisher, a reader, a writer, a soccer midfielder, a journalist, and a coder. As captain of her high school's math team and founder of the Needham Chapter of Girls Who Code Clubs, she is passionate about encouraging interest in STEM. She pursues journalism as editor in chief of her school newspaper and writing for her local paper, with a special interest in the increasing shift towards digital in the publication industry. Dianne's favorite languages are Latin and Python.

###Nick Hluska

> Nick is the team leader for Stergeron. He has competed in the American Computer Science League and attended the Blueprint Hackathon.

Hi everyone.My name is Hristo and I'm a 19 years old software engineering student. I'm going to be building a WebGL game using
Three.js & Javascript(of course). I have an idea about the game and I won't be revealing it just yet so stay in touch.

I'm also looking for people to join my team that's why I will give you a brief introduction about what I can do and what my skills are.
For the past 6 months I have been working in a company in the area of computational chemistry. I'm involved in projects which
for the most part solve problems with the help of graph theory. This is where my strength lies. I"m also a C# certified specialist
and I have some good amount of experience developing applications & also a good amount of presentation skills. I'm also lucky enough
to be a MSP and MCP. If you are passionate about games and like to create stuff that move please don't hesitate to contact me.
I'm looking for technically skilled persons and design and user interface is going to be the second most important thing.

Thanks !

We are a team of designers & developers. In short - We are GEEKS from the future!!

We have joined the hackathon to contribute our share to the community. If we win it will not be just for the sake of name & fame BUT so that we can invest it into our further developing ideas. We are small team short on funds & we are desperately looking for some help. We have lot of ideas developing from the last 7 years of working in different streams. But they are still ideas as they never developed into concepts. If we win this, we are definitely going to get moving forward from here. Fingers crossed!!


Our Team Skills & Background:
=======================

Vijayinder (a.k.a: VJ): I started my coding journey 7 years back with .net technology. After few years of struggling & going through different technologies, I finally ended up on php. Which lead me learning WordPress as a platform. Since then it has been a great experience of learning from scratch to being an expert in WordPress theme development. I now have knowledge of WordPress Responsive Theme development -> Joomla as a platform -> Magento Theme Development as well.
I am working with a great team that I have combined after years of working together & trust. We are taking multiple projects monthly, especially related to development of wordpress themes & portfolios. Apart from that I have also trained myself in Internet Marketing Techniques, as well as I have knowledge of adwords and adroll just to assist clients with their businesses when needed.

Sneha (a.k.a: Mam): Hi there!! My name is Sneha Samfrancisco, I'm graphic designer & web developer working in this field for more than 7 years. Till date I have designed & developed a wide range of websites including: E-commerce websites, Business websites, Landing pages. The web designing & development technologies that I am expert at using include: Photoshop, Illustrator, HTML5/CSS3, Corel Draw X4. Open source platforms that I have expertise includes: WordPress, Magento, Joomla, Prestashop etc. I love working with new challenges. I believe in communication & my belief is that "Communication is the key to a successful Project" So let's start achieving success..!!

Swapnil (a.k.a: Neal): I started my career as an Mech Engineer with ACC Cement limited, where I was selected from campus placement. It was a great experience as I was part of project team for almost 3 years. In all these times, my actual interest remained in designing softwares such as Autocad. After a span of three years I decided to quit job with ACC and I started learning design and development. After 6 months of training from VJ & Sneha, learning the designing & development basics, tools as in Photoshop & Dreamweaver etc, I was all set with the industry standards and started working professionally as a freelancer designer & developer. Pretty soon work started to flow & now I am working on multiple projects for clients overseas. All these years, the experience of handling projects (planning & excuting) from the previous job, always came handy. It's been almost 3 years now working in the IT industry & it's been a really great journey so far. Looking forward to many more :)


What we are going to do?
=======================
We are in a bit of confusion at the current moment, when it comes to deciding what we are planning to create. But definitely we are planning to stick to the theme which will help support a global cause. And which will make things easier for the general public, when it comes to designing & coding. We'll be most probably using WordPress as a platform. As soon as we finalize the API's to be used, we'll update here. Thank you.

Currently a one-member team.

## About Me

I have been fascinated with computers since I was four years old, and have been coding in various languages for over 20 years with an emphasis in web development.

While I have a vast general knowledge of modern technology in general, my areas of expertise are primarily related to LAMP, HTML5/CSS3, Javascript/jQuery, and ImageMagick, but I also have extensive experience in many other areas.


---------------------------------------

T314
================

I'm a freelance developer, interested in Web development
Hackathon – a good incentive to apply my knowledge of different areas in a single project

My goal is not to win, it's a challenge for me – in a short period of time to create a project that will be useful for many people

the most interesting theme for me is "HTML5 educational multiplayer game"

I will use PHP + node.js + iron.io and WebGL + Canvas... may also WebSpeechAPI


---------------------------------------

TNTeam
========

## Who we Are

Our team consists of a mix of experienced hacker veterans, promising
programming rising stars, and artists, all from Tunisia.  Some of us
know each other since quite a while now (Rafik and Mohamed were
classmates since high school), met during work (Rafik , Elyes and
Ibtissem are coworkers) or while attending Kendo training (Rafik and
Chakib are Kenshis). But all in all, TNTeam is made of only friends,
that share a deep love for hacking and love arts.

* `Rafik` and `Mohamed` are Back-End Developers and
architects. They'll probably will write Clojure and Java. `Mohamed` is
an egg on twitter because he chose to.
* `Ibtissem` is an experienced Front-End infrastructure engineer,
though also having her word to say on back-end side of things. She
knows a couple of things about Clojure, Java, HTML5 and JS.
* `Elyes` is a promising Web Developer, experienced in designing and
integrating cool web apps.
* `Chakib` is the artist of the team. He will create unique AND
  amazing artwork for our work.

And here's what we all look like:

Rafik | Mohamed | Ibtissem | Elyes | Chakib
----- |-------- |--------- |------ |--------

## So what are we cooking for you?

Still thinking about it. But it will surely be somthing special !
Very likely, we'll use some clojure, java, some html5/CSS3 magic... stay tuned !

On the very first sight we are ordinary team with team lead and coders. On the other hand each of us is "The One". 
We are personalities with high ambitions, self-motivation and professional background.

We are participating in Hackathon to prove ourselves, get great non-stop-Koding experience and to get fun (Koding is funny, isn't it?).


"Wazzap"
=======
Like most of checked-in teams we are "still brainstormin". We are going to use up-to-date technologies. 
At this moment, seems that we will use PHP/node.js + MySQL/Mongo (maybe hybrid), Angular.js, DataDog API, nginx for server and some of provided APIs (we are not sure yet).


Best wishes
===========
We are wishing all the luck to all participients (ofcourse we have it already taken). Let the Koding begin! :)

Hey! I'm a high school student who loves to learn Computer Scince. I've been learning about computers and the web ever since elementary school. Starting from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to programming languages in middle school such as PHP, and Visual Basic. Now in high school, I have mastered PHP and Java. I have visited Googleplex after becoming the Grand Prize Winner in Google Code-In 2013, the first ever programming contest I participated in. 

This will be my first Hackathon, and I am excited to be taking part in the first global hackathon!


Skills / Plans
==============
I am interested in theme 5, challenges associated with real time communication and translation. Although PHP is my best language, I will try to use Node.js to solve this problem as you can have real-time direct connections with the server and the client using socket.io.

About the Team

We are Team Banana Stand. We're from Toronto, Canada.

| Peony | Manu | Jason | Travis

| <img width="100" height="100" src='https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/498100595962937344/iFcCo2ci_400x400.jpeg' alt='Peony'/> | <img width="100" height="100" src='https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/378800000041376391/36373bdf958000782d38565d415c9b43_400x400.jpeg' alt='Manu'/> | <img width="100" height="100" src='https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/2246824386/badASS_400x400.jpg' alt='Jason'/> | <img width="100" height="100" src='https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/2218626636/image_400x400.jpg' alt='Travis'/> |

TL;DR: Travis, Peony and Jason are partial-full stack developers and Manu is a janitor. They all share a common love for science.

1. Peony is a web designer and front-end developer. She prefers to work at the bleeding edge of front-end spec, and her workflow would probably make Paul Irish jealous.
2. Manu is not a janitor IRL, he's more like a services savant. If you need service development, or simply some sweet Python magic, he's your man.
3. When he's not busy saving the world from best practice failures or thinking of what to tweet next, Jason is busy building stuff while using a mindblowing variety of resources. Apps, web-apps, APIs, you name it. If Macgyver needed the equivalent of a developer swiss-army knife, Jason would make the role.
4. Travis is a front-end developer who has a lot of experience with devops because it "comes with the territory". In a previous life, he was a backend dev. On that note, he's currently doing his best to hate PHP and love NodeJS.

Joining was Peony's idea, and needless to say, we all jumped at the chance to be a part of global hackathon. Win or lose, we're looking to challenge ourselves by implementing as much as possible into our final idea. 

Skills and Plans
=======
As a combined team, we use these languages on the daily:
- Javascript
- Python
- Scala
- Objective C
- Java
- PHP

APIs that we are like include but are not limited to:
- DATADOG
- Twitter
- Google Predictions
- Google Geocoding
- Google Freebase

We're trying to come up with an impressive idea that has a tight-enough scope to complete in time. Ideally this is going to be a web-app that's out-of-the-box in nature, is built on services leveraging a plethora of APIs, and has a gorgeous front end. After throwing ideas around for the past few evenings, the team is mostly talking about going with either themes #1 or #5.

Hi, I'm Yishu. I should be doing homework right now, but this koding thing sounds so cool.

## About me

A few years ago, I took a programming class in high school,
became a little familiar with C,
and totally fell in love with programming.

Now I'm in college, took my first physics class, 
we used vPython during lab to model physics,
and now I'm even more in love with coding.


It makes me happy :)

We've worked together for around 3 years, and between us we have over ten years of webdev experience.

Whether it be our own startup or one of the many freelance projects we've completed together, we've always prided ourselves on pushing boundaries and doing new things. So when we heard about the Koding Hackathon, and saw the themes, we jumped right on to the idea.

We can't wait to show everyone our idea.

Goal
=======

We plan to create a real time chat application with a very unique twist, keep an eye out!

[James]: http://i.imgur.com/6WhfoIZm.png?2 "A day in the life"
[Jake]: http://i.imgur.com/IFEuZNEm.png?2 "Khakis"

`Ethan`'s experience lies primarily with Java, although he has dabbled in and is learning other languages. He has published two applications: [En Garde'/>, an Android fencing score-keeping app, and [HyperTyper](http://ethanmad.com/HyperTyper), a Chrome extension that helps (cheats) in online typing competitions. He has little experience with the Web outside of static websites, so he is looking to learn a lot with The Washington Redskins.

`David` is passionate about teaching others how to 'Kode', as demonstrated by his project, [Koding 4 Kids](http://koding4kids.com). Right now, however, his teaching is on hold until we teach y'all a lesson.

`Christian`, also known as 'quantum' or '[paralin](http://parl.in)' is known primarily for [D2Moddin](http://paral.in/the-d2moddin-project/), which brought custom game modes to over 174,000 DOTA 2 players. Christian's in-progress projects include two other DOTA projects, WebLeague and DotaReplay, in addition to his VTOL PixHawk autonomous UAV project. Previous projects are listed on [his website](http://paral.in/projects/) with links to GitHub repositories.

`James` is an algorithms expert and is top 50 on the USACO rankings in 2014. James actually [invented the subordinate-sequential search algorithm](https://koding.com/jlennon1) with the help of fellow Koders. James has also created several published games, including [Nebulus](https://itunes.apple.com/app/nebulous-multiplayer-space/id874328065?mt=8) and [Driftlight](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/driftlight/id908131148?mt=8).

`Jake` is an esteemed hacker who often goes by the name of '4chan'. He's apparently very infamous. You better not go and tell CNN his real name!

## What we're making

It's quite possible that we are inventing the most revolutionary product ever made! [As part of our review of playing field, we have decided to move forward with cloud-based early adopter. Skate to where the puck is going to be.](http://projects.wsj.com/buzzwords2014/#p=13%7C35,13%7C%7C6%7C%7C2%7C2) Steve Jobs may [1] have decreed "the iRedskins (formerly The Washington Redksins) is the most revolutionary and magical product Apple has made yet" while tripping on an LCD in India.

About the team and team members?

I am Parth Pankaj Tiwary and I am from India, I am currently in the 3rd year of my 4 year bachelors degree in 
computer science and engineering. Data fascinates me and the way we structure our data in order to make some sense
out of it, I have a thing for typography and I am a strong believer of minimalist approach, I do try and keep things
simple.


About the skills that I have or I might use in this hackathon?

I have co-founded one startup that is frameinn.com, I do know Django, python and its recently that I have ventured
for MEAN stack and what can be made using MEAN stack.  I have a thing for data visualization, as it precisely explains
what minimalistic appraoch is. I guess that is most of it, I will be taking up a project related to the data and the
way we have structured our data so far and how should we go about changing it, in order to put it to its actual use.

The HD One
================
Hello world! My name is Pavel, and I'm the only member of the team. It's my first hackathon and I hope it will be fun.

A little bit about me
===========================
I'm software engineer from Kharkiv, Ukraine. Decision to participate in Koding Hackathon was a spontaneous, but I think it's a very good chance for me to verify my experience in out of the ordinary situation.

<img width="100" height="100" src='https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/333910?v=3&s=256' alt='bashmach | The HD One'/>


About your skills and what you are going to do?
===========================

At the moment I'm not totally sure about theme of my project, but most likely it would be something that is related with realtime data streaming.

Planning to use Node.js as a main platform.

---------------------------------------

The Thought Engineer
================

This is Samer Bechara, The Thought Engineer. I'm participating in this koding hackathon for a change, for a challenge, and winning! (Doh!)


About me
===========================

I've been developing web applications since 2007, and by 2010 I became pretty good - or that's what I like to think.

I've been working online since 2007 , back when we had 128Kbps internet here in Lebanon. For the first few years, my parent and my friends thought I was crazy, but then I understood that I was making money online, not trying to run away from finding a real job.

I've decided to joing because I wanted to challenge myself, and solve some of the problems in your koding themes (No- I'm not telling which one now - we still haven't started!)

I don't care if I win or not, seriously! What I really care about is overcoming myself and pushing my boundaries. Winning is just a secondary result, not the main goal. (Judges - don't let that influence you. I still like to win)


What am I really good at, and what am I going to do?
=======

The more complex the problem is, the simpler the solution I come up with. I've programmed tens of APIs, done frontend and backend programming, managed servers, and market my own business. 

Programming isn't just about writing code, it's about solving problems the world is facing. If you want to kill my soul, ask me to reinvent the wheel. I focus as much as I can on creating innovative solutions for problems that my clients are facing. If a solution has been already created, no need to create it again. Programmers, you can change the world, so stop writing contact forms! :)

Most probably I'll be working on solving the TOS problem. As a website owner and website visitor, it's a problem I fairly undertand and now, and believe that I have some pretty cool ideas to solve this problem.

Tell us who you are, why you did you decide to join?
======
I love coding, and it is not just my job, it’s my hobby, business, love, my life. 
For the short while I have been on this earth. Developing has been a huge part of my life, so much that if I didn’t have development I would be lost.
I love to play with it, In my spare time I surf the web to keep in touch with new technologies. 
I am working with web applications from last 4+ year.
I am also a nature lover, and I love more than coding, I try to help to save the nature.
I am also master degree student & family responsibilities so I have no much time to physically help them (http://support.wwfindia.org/sos/index.php) but I had decided to donate some part of my salary to them before two months. I also would like to donate 10% of my prize.

About my skills and what I am going to do?
=======

I will use:

1. html
2. javascript
3. php
4. nginx
5. postgres
6. other things

I will choose #1 or #4 theme.


---------------------------------------

UniLasers
=============

We're team UniLasers, a small team of two people based out of Toronto. We consider ourselves hobbyist programmers, we enjoy programming but don't have enough chances to do so at work or after work. Neither of us have ever participated in a Hackathon before, but this global Hackathon seems like a great place to begin! 

It's time to see how well we stack up against the other 1999 teams in this Hackathon! 

What we're going to do
=============

Honestly, we're not sure yet. One of us is stronger with backend technologies, one of us is better with frontend, so we'll see how that goes.

We're still deciding between the first and third theme as those two plays to our strengths, we'll commit a change to this file once we decide!

For sure we'll be making use of PHP, nginx, and a bunch of JavaScript libraries that can help us code fast in 48h. Any other APIs and technologies will be determined once we decide on a theme.

Koding's instructions for writing ABOUT.md tell you to make it emotional and impressive. I find it more important to make it honest. I'm Frederik Creemers, a Belgian web geek. I'm visually impaired. My optic nerves never fully developed, so glasses don't help.
Because of my impairment, I've always needed the help of technology. In high school, at a point where I was supposed to be doing homework, I started toying around in powerpoint. I found out a feature that allowed you to go to a different slide when the mouse hovered
over a certain element of the current slide. This gave me the great idea to create mouse mazes, where you had to get your cursor from start to finish without touchhing a wall. This got me more interested in how games were created, and so I  downloaded GameMaker, a tool by YoYoGames,
that allows you to create games without programming. It does include a language called GML (game maker language), which was my introduction to programming. At school, we learned how to make a website, which introdduced me to the wonders of the web as a platform, and that's what got me to where I currently am.

The reason I'm entering this hackathon, is because I sometimes need a little push to release something. I've got a lot of projects in my 'dev' directory that are hafway there to being something I could release to the world. I'm hoping that this hackathon will push me to create something that I can be proud of.


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
I'm creating an app that allows people without any coding experience to create their own web application.
Some of the things I'll probably use:

 - blockly
 - github's api
 - Google App Engine
 - Any other APi I can build in in time that can enhance the applications that users build.
 
I might change my mind, and build applications using firebase instead of App Engine.

<h1><b>This is our page</b></h1>

<em>Well actually it's just me for now. I am from Bosnia and Herzegovina, currently living in Sarajevo.</em>

<h1><b>About your team</b></h1>

<em>My name is Emina Šahbegović, I am twenty-one years old and I am a second year student at International Burch Univercity in 
Sarajevo, Bosnia. I have decided to try and join the hackaton because I am a curious person and like to take as many 
opportunities as possible to gather more knowledge when it comes to programming. I have fallen in love with 
programming and would like to become one of the best programmers in this world, but since I started relatively late compared to 
my colleagues it will probably take some time till I get there. I would really like to become one of the best programmers for 
two reasons. First reason would have to be so I can pay my family everything back that they invested in me and finally be 
independent. The second reason is because I really respect smart people and would love to become a smart person who is needed 
in society.</em>

<h1><b>Abut your skills and what you are going to do?</b></h1>

<em>Since my skills in coding are still at a beginners level, it's possible that it won't kick people from their chairs but 
I will try to make the best project I've made yet. I do have some skills ehn it comes to design and art so hopefully it will 
make up a little for the lack of knowledge in coding. I will try to build a PC game and it will, hopefully, be interesting.</em>

cool_kid_alert
================
Just a high schooler on the east coast who wants to test his skills. I doubt I will win, but I just want to see what participating feels like.

Never really knew what I wanted to do until my first day of Freshman year, when I walked into Computer Science class Period 1.
Hello World in Java seemed magical to me, and I knew exactly what I wanted to do when I "grew up".
Since then, I've tried to learn as much as I can, as fast I can. 
I found myself overreaching at one point, trying to become a coding polyglot- I was trying to learn 3 or more languages at once, which did not work. So I focused on learning a few things, and learning them well.

And I got an internship at an informatics lab! 

Skills/Experience
================
Javascript, Java, HTML/CSS.
D3.js, Node, Sails.

I want to make an interactive website to explain and visualize the severity of Global Warming with interactive charts of all shapes and sizes.
Obviously, I'd use d3.js for that.
Another cool idea would be a way for people to highlight the most important parts of a legal document for users to read and then some sort of game to make sure people read those sentences, at least.

to write cleaner foreign language.  Natural language, I mean, like English.

Welcome to Hawaii Hackers
================

I am a student studying computer science at the University of Hawaii at Hilo.


About your team
===========================
I'm a Senior in the Computer Science department at UH Hilo. I first came to Hawaii in search of a fresh start back in December of 2007. 
I didn't really know what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, but I did know I needed a way to make a living. I took a job with a
large ornamental plant farm. It was hard work, and the pay was just barely enough to get by. Yet, in spite of all of this, riding around
on a tractor all day gave me a great deal of time to think. And as I thought, I realized that I wanted to go back to school. 

I enrolled at Hawaii Community College in its Information Technology program back in the Spring of 2009. Going back to school breathed
new ambition and new life into my soul, and so I decided to leave the farm and eventually took a job with Upward Bound, a college prep for
low income and first generation high schoolers, as a tech instructor for their Summer Academy. They were pleased with the way I interacted
with the students, and with my knowledge of computers, and ultimately offered me a position as their IT Specialist.

I graduated from the IT Program in the Spring of 2011 at the top of my class. From there, I made the decision to transfer to UH Hilo's 
Computer Science Program. The CS Program has taught me a love for programming and problem solving that I never knew I had. I became extremely
interested in AI, Machine Learning, Image Processing, and Datamining, and have been supplementing the education I've received with free online courses from
Coursera and Udacity. I am also an active member of ACM, and have particpiated in two Intercollegiate Programming Competitions, as well
as the NYU Poly  Cyber Security Awareness Week Capture the Flag, Google Codejam, and IBM's Master the Mainframe.

My studies keep me very busy, but I do manage to get some downtime in where I like to hit the beach, go diving with my father, play video games, or practice jujitsu. As my education comes to a close, it is unclear if I will be able to remain in this amazing place that has 
changed my life so much, but winning this competition would certainly be a step in the right direction.  

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
As I mentioned above, my main interests fall along the lines of AI, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Datamining, so I definitely plan to use my knowledge from at least one of these domains. I may take a whack at the real time communication theme, but being an educator myself, I may go in the direction of creating an interactive activity for first time software developers. API wise, I see a lot of interesting API's on
Mashape, and API Tools, so plan on seeing API's from at least one of these sites. Moreover, I'll probably use QUANDL if I find that I need a large dataset unless I find a suitable dataset elsewhere. 




---------------------------------------

After working together in a corporate market research company we've since gone our separate ways. This is an opportunity for us to get the team back together, test our skills and hopefully make the world a better place along the way.


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======

We're all full stack C#/.NET developers, although we're most likely going to be using a NodeJS backend. We've a fair amount of experience with data visualisation so you may see something from us there, although we all love to learn so watch this space.

## About

I programmed in many languages before. I really do love the idea of funcational programming
and it has managed to creep its way into my C programming.. Eek!

For prototyping I use processing, arduino and python. Since this is a hackathon, something tells
me I'll be coding in processing this hackathon!

## Quick overview of idea
A game written in processing accompanied by teaching material and good documentation.

The learning theme, simply put.

Okay, that wasn't too revealing :D Happy hacking!

# megusta

I'm Ivan and I just looooooove little software and hardware helpers that make life easier.
But sometimes little things overgrow to big ugly monster, so it's better to kill them than develop -__-.
I hope, this time I'll focus on one thing and won't use whole bucket of technologies
just for one simple purpose. :)

# What skills do I have?

Well, I'm kinda web developer with mixin of mobile developer who can speak following languages
(and speaks them in daily life):

 - PHP
 - golang
 - C# (Silverlight)
 - Javascript

My idea is to work on gathering and processing one kind of statistics that will serve well to 80%
of possible users. I'll focus on usability, because "usable" thing means "something that helps me
every day".

#About this singleton

###Who, me?
I am Prajogo Tio, an (computer) engineering student from *Nanyang Technological University*, Year 2.
I have just started learning about programming more or less 11 months (I started learning in December 2013).
Since then I've been hooked by the computing world and wanted to gain ever more awesome experience.
I might be very green and incompetent (I admit it) but I believe I have to start somewhere.
That is my main motivation in participating in this Hackathon, and hopefully I might have the chance to compete.

###Interests
I've enjoyed programming several HTML5 Games using mainly Javascript and Canvas. 
Two main games I've written so far are:
  1. A 2D side scrolling spaceship game to test out prototypal inheritence in JS. [view](http://prajogotio.github.io/Space/Space.html)
  2. Another one is 2.5D FPS game (I call it BOOM) based on Raycasting principles to emulate 3D in 2D engine. Pretty fun! [view](http://prajogotio.github.io/boom/boom.html)
You may want to check out my Github IO page to test them:
[prajogotio.github.io](prajogotio.github.io)

I'm also actively participating in algorithm contests just to keep my mind in check. I love learning and I will never stop.
I do keep a log on what I've learnt in my blogspot: [abitofcs.blogspot.sg](abitofcs.blogspot.sg)

###Hopes
I am looking for a chance to strengthen my foundation in code design and planning. I hope I get a chance to learn from this Hackathon.

Thank you for taking your time to read this page.

Regards,
   Prajogo Tio

I'm a scientist (mainly with climate-related subjects) who has been writing code for research and 
outreach for many years. I am interested in numerical modeling and visualizations that help
make sense of the world in beautiful ways. 



Why I want to win
===================================
I have an idea about how to create more beautiful and interactive visualizations of global climate fields 
(like surface temperature) and I want to bring that idea into production for a large audience 
so they can see for themselves how the global climate has behaved, and that they can play with the data to draw their own conclusions from data.

Skills
============== 
- Javascript 
- HTML5 
- SVG 
- sed/awk/shell scripts etc
- NOAA/NASA APIs for the data

The idea
=======             
I'm going to tackle the climate question...by developing a better way to present public datasetes from 
NOAA and NASA.
